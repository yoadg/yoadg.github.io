Any software is useless without hardware. The cloud is built on top of an enormous amount of phsyical compute machines, also known as servers. Although you don't own them and you can't see them, they are somwhere on the ground (or maybe below the ground or even the sea), consuming a lot of energy and running your software. Yes, even if you use so-called "serverless" services. A software can only run on some sort of a phyiscal computer or computing device.
