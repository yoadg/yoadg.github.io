January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the [Internet](/wiki/network#internet-protocol-suite). On this day Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) and the Defense Data Network officially changed to the TCP/IP standard. By 1987, there were nearly 30,000 hosts on the Internet. In 1989 the proposal for the World Wide Web was written by Tim Berners-Lee. In 1990 the first commercial dial-up Internet service provider enabled Internet connection for home users. In 1991, the first web page was created. 

That was the year when I got my first PC (Intel 286 CPU) as a CS student, but it didn’t have any network interface. It’s hard to imagine today, but this PC was completely offline. If I wanted to transfer data from/to this PC, I had to use floppy disks. Few years later I got my first dial-up modem. It needed a phone line to connect and the bandwidth was rather low, but it marked the beginning of the Internet era. The Internet quickly became popular and grew at a rapid pace. Our world today relies on the Internet. Without it, many essential systems would fail. It is obviously one of the fundamental enablers of [cloud computing](/wiki/cloud). When we access the cloud, we connect to remote services over the Internet. Also within the cloud, nodes communicate over the network. Therefore, it is important to understand how [computer network](/wiki/network/) is structured and the communication protocols that are used.
